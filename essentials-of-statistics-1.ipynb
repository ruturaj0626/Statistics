If you can count the possible values it can assume, it's considered a discrete variable. An illustrative example of a discrete variable is the outcome of rolling a six-sided die. In this case, the variable can only have one of six distinct outcomes, making it discrete. Additionally, a discrete random variable can have an infinite number of values, such as the set of natural numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.), which is countable and therefore discrete.\n\nIn statistical analysis, we represent the distribution of discrete variables using two key functions:\n- **PMF (Probability Mass Function)**: The PMF defines the probability associated with all possible values of the discrete random variable. It tells us the likelihood of each specific outcome.\n\n- **CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function)**: The CDF represents the cumulative probability that the random variable X will have an outcome less than or equal to a given value x. The name CDF is used both for discrete and continuous distributions.\n\n### Continuous Variables\n\nIn contrast, a **continuous variable** can take on an \"uncountable\" number of values within a specific range. A classic example of a continuous variable is length. Length can be measured to any degree of precision, making it continuous.\n\nFor continuous variables, we use different probability functions compared to discrete ones:\n- **PDF (Probability Density Function)**: The PDF serves a similar purpose as the PMF but for continuous values. It describes the likelihood of the variable taking on specific values within a given range.\n\n- **CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function)**: Just like for discrete variables, the CDF for continuous variables represents the cumulative probability that the random variable X will have an outcome less than or equal to a given value x.\n\nWhile the mathematical functions that define PMFs, PDFs, and CDFs can appear complex at first, their visual representations are often more intuitive.
